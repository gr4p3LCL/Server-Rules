# WRAP - Warfare Regulations And Protocols

1. **Declaration of War**: Before engaging in war with another player or faction, a formal declaration of war must be made. This can be done through in-game chat, private message, or any other official communication channels on the server.

2. **Acceptance of War**: The opposing party must acknowledge the declaration of war. This can be in the form of a written response or a clear indication of acceptance.

3. **War Zones**: During a declared war, specific war zones will be established as legitimate battlegrounds. These war zones may include targets that the opposing party owns, such as resource-rich areas or strategic locations. However, the war zones must not include the home base or areas where players make or obtain food. It is essential to balance the objectives of war without compromising essential resources or preventing players from acquiring sustenance.

4. **No Griefing Outside War Zones**: While war allows for conflict, griefing or causing deliberate destruction outside designated war zones is strictly prohibited.

5. **No Use of Nuclear Weapons Outside War Zones**: The use of nuclear weapons is limited to designated war zones and specifically established testing sites. Players are not allowed to use nuclear bombs outside these areas, especially near public spaces or player settlements. However, within the designated testing sites, players can conduct nuclear weapon testing for experimental purposes.

6. **Respect Surrender**: If one party formally surrenders during a war, the opposing party must respect the terms of surrender. The server operator may also facilitate negotiations if needed.

7. **Post-War Reparations**: If significant damage occurs during a war, the victorious party should assist in the rebuilding process, or reparations can be negotiated between the parties involved.

8. **PvP during Peace Time**: Outside of declared wars, players are allowed to engage in non-consensual PvP (player-versus-player) combat. However, during peace time, players must refrain from causing deliberate destruction of each other's property. PvP should be limited to combat between players without damaging their bases, structures, or belongings.

9. **Rules of Engagement**: Establish clear rules of engagement for battles during war, such as whether certain items or tactics are allowed or restricted.
