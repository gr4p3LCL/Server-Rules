# Primary Rules

1. **No Griefing**: Respect other players' creations and property. Do not intentionally destroy or alter someone else's builds without their permission. Griefing incidents will be taken seriously, and perpetrators will be subject to investigation and appropriate consequences.

2. **No Cheating or Hacking**: Do not use cheats, hacks, unauthorized mods, or X-ray texture packs. These give unfair advantages and disrupt the balanced gameplay for others. The punishment for violating this rule will be determined based on the severity of the offense and will be judged on a case-by-case basis.

3. **Server Operator's Final Say**: The server operator has the final say in matters related to rule enforcement, dispute resolution, and any other server-related decisions. Their decisions are to be respected and followed by all players. Appeals or concerns can be brought to the server operator's attention through appropriate channels, but ultimately, their judgment will prevail.
