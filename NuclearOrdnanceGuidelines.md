# NOG - Nuclear Ordnance Guidelines

1. **No Griefing with Nuclear Weapons**: Refer to Rule 1 of the primary ruleset.

2. **Safety Precautions**: When using nuclear weapons, players must take safety precautions to minimize collateral damage. This may include setting up a safe distance from their own and other players' structures.

3. **Cleanup Responsibility**: Players who use nuclear weapons are responsible for cleaning up the fallout or repairing any damage caused to the environment or other players' property. If a nuclear weapon is used on another player's property without permission, the property owner has the right to take legal action and pursue a case against the offending player.

4. **Private Areas**: Prior permission must be obtained from any player before using a nuclear weapon near their creations, bases, or territories.

5. **Public Areas**: Under no circumstances should you use nuclear bombs in or within 20 chunks of a public space. Violating this rule will result in "Destruction Of Public Property," with a minimum sentence of a 2-day ban and a maximum sentence of a 4-day ban.

6. **Designated Zones**: Players who wish to conduct nuclear testing must build and section off a designated area for these activities. This area should be situated away from player settlements and other significant structures to minimize the risk of unintentional damage. Clear signage indicating the testing zone is also recommended to avoid accidental intrusions.
   - **Note**: If nuclear testing is not conducted within a marked zone, the consequences will be judged on a case-by-case basis by the server operator.

7. **Alert the Server Operator**: Players must inform the server operator when they have developed nuclear weapons. Upon notification, it will be announced to the entire server that the player possesses nuclear weapons, and their name will be added to a list of authorized users.
   - **Consequences for Unauthorized Possession and Detonation**: If a player is found to be in possession of nuclear weapons without being on the list of authorized users, they will be charged with "Possession of a Restricted Weapon," with a minimum sentence of a temporary ban (duration determined by the server operator) and a maximum sentence of a permanent ban. In the event that an unauthorized player detonates a nuclear weapon, they will face charges of "Possession of a Restricted Weapon" and "Unlawful Discharge of a Restricted Weapon," with a minimum sentence of a permanent ban and a maximum sentence of a permanent ban.

8. **Nuclear Weapons in War**: Players are allowed to use nuclear weapons against other players during times of war. However, there are specific guidelines and rules for conducting warfare on the server. Please refer to WRAP (WarfareRegulationsAndProtocols.md) for the complete set of rules related to wars and the use of nuclear weapons in such situations.

9. **Consequences for Misuse**: Violation of nuclear weapon sub-rules can result in severe consequences, such as temporary or permanent bans, depending on the severity of the offense.
